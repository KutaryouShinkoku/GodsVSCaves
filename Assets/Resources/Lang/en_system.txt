Tutorial_desc$1. Combat is automatic and players cannot intervene.\n\n2. Heroes have their own six-sided die. The die sides represent different skills (6 is the ultimate skill). The points will also determine the random number range of damage.\n\n3. Heroes' dice have different personalities, and the weight of each side will also change according to changes in the battle situation.\n\n4. Heroes' luck will affect the critical hit chance, the possibility of resisting critical hits, and the size of the die point.\n\n5. You can bet on the hero you support in the first 20 seconds of combat.
